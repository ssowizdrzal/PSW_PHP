                    Beyond Gaming mid laner Maoan has allegedly leaked draft strats for betting purposes
                </h3>
                <p >
                    During the 2021 World Championship, Maoan violated Rule 9.3 of the 2021 World Championship Ruleset, which prohibits association with gambling. 
                    Competitive integrity is the foundation for our sport and we take all violations of our ruleset extremely seriously. 
                    The Competitive Operations team obtained definitive evidence showing Maoan provided inside information to a friend for the purposes of wagering on today's match. 
                    Maoan will be suspended for the remained fo the 2021 World Champinoship, and may be subject to additional penalties following a full investigation.

                    People should respect Garen more
                </h3>
                <p>To preface this, I used to be quite athletic, and by virtue of my handsome face, I worked part-time as a model. However, I got old, and my metabolism slowed down,
                     and I couldn’t keep slim while eating shit like before. Last Christmas, I got pretty chubby.
                    <br>   <br>
                    Now, until recently, I just let this be, but over the last two weeks, I went on a diet, didn’t eat a lot, drank tons of water and within two weeks lost 5KG.
                    <br>   <br>
                    But what struck me the most was halfway through the week, I wanted to eat so badly. I wanted to buy a sleeve of cookies and nom them down. But in my mind,
                     I said to myself, ‘I will not falter,’ and that’s when it hit me. Garen deserves a lot more respect; that man never falters; in all the years he’s been around,
                      he never did. I only just managed for two weeks, but he’s managed for a lifetime.
                    <br>   <br>
                    He deserves more credit. He may not be the brightest spark, but he was something we should all strive for—the will to never falter.
