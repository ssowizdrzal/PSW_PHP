                Our mid-game has been pretty lackluster, pretty bad. It’s getting exposed against some of the best teams in the world... we’ve been doing fine in scrims against [NA and EU] teams for the most part, but when we scrim Asian teams, we’re getting fisted.

                I just found out today that one of my best friends died. All I can think about is the last time he asked me to play league with him and how I turned him down. I would give anything to go back and play with him again. He introduced me to the game, and I have been playing and watching since Season 2. I'm so sad to think that he is now gone. If you have a friend that you play or played league with, Play a game with them.
